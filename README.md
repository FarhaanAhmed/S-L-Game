# GameProjectSnakesAndLadders
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I created a fully functioning. The game I decided to make was a snakes and ladders game, it has a two player functionality and requires the user to roll a six on the device in order to get there piece move onto the board.

In order to run the game you simply download the zip, extract it and simply click the index.html file in the project folder in order to run the game. Alternatively, you could run the project in a program such as atom to view the code behind the game and simply just right-click the index.html file and click open in browser in order to run the game.
